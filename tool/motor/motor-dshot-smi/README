This is an implementation of the DSHOT protocol to control ESCs
via the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi.  It was developed and used on
Raspberry Pi Zero 2, other versions were not tested.

Comparing to a simple implementation based on busy wait loop this
implementation is using SMI interface and DMA to generate dshot
protocol. It is less CPU consuming and works well even if CPU is
loaded by other tasks. However, it works only for pins between GPIO 8
and GPIO 25.

SMI and DMA implementation is using Jeremy Benthem work
https://iosoft.blog/category/secondary-memory-interface/.

To compile and run a simple test that spins 4 motors connected to GPIO
16, 19, 20 and 21, type

    	   make test
	   sudo ./test 16 19 20 21

If it does not work, you may need to edit 'motor-dshot-smi.c' and adjust
DSHOT_VERSION and/or DSHOT_SMI_TIMING macro.
